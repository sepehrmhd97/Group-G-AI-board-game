Welcome to Mill! 
The Goal of the game is to remove your opponents pieces 
so that they only have two left. At that point you win! 

There is one additional victory condition. When your opponent
can’t make a move on their turn they lose by default. 

If 200 turns pass without a victor the game will automatically 
end in a draw.

The game is turn-based where pieces can be placed on empty slots 
on the game board. Placing or moving a piece counts as one action. 
You are afforded one action per turn. Once three of your pieces are
placed in a row a mill is created. Once created you can remove a piece
from the opponent. This does not count towards your action.


The game has three different stages with associated rules. A player can
be in a different stage than their opponent. The stages are:

Stage 1:
You and your opponent will start with 12 pieces each. You may place one
piece on any empty slot on the board per turn. Once a mill 
(three of your pieces in a row) is created you may also remove an
opponent's piece that turns.

Once all 12 pieces have been played, regardless of the amount
of pieces on the board, the stage ends.

Stage 2:
This stage will continue until one player only has three pieces 
remaining. At this stage players will move pieces around the board
creating mills in an attempt to reduce an opponents pieces or to trap
them into not being able to make a legal move. Pieces can only move to 
an adjacent empty slot. Mills work the same. 

Stage 3:
When a player only has 3 pieces left their pieces can “fly” meaning 
that they can be moved to any empty slot, not just adjacent ones like 
before. Beware that losing a piece at that stage will result in only 
two pieces and therefore a loss.

Remember, once a player can’t make a move on their turn they lose. 
Also the game will end in a draw after turn 200. You can also forfeit 
the game if you want. Exiting the game works to but will be
counted as a forfeit. A draw can be initiated but your opponent 
must accept it to be put into effect.

We hope you will enjoy your games of Mill!
